                    <span class="fw-bolder">Bitcoin Adds More Than 70% to its Value in 2021</span><br>
                    2021 is coming to an end, and Bitcoin remains the most dominant cryptocurrency in the world. The
                    cryptocurrency’s value has experienced a massive increase in value over the past 52 weeks,
                    outperforming numerous major financial assets such as Gold during that period.

                    In the last 52 weeks, Bitcoin’s price has risen by 72%. Bitcoin began 2021 trading around $32k per
                    coin after it surpassed its 2017 all-time high of $20,000 towards the end of 2020. The leading
                    cryptocurrency continued its 2020 rally in 2021 and quickly reached a new all-time high above $64k
                    by April.

                    The rally came as the adoption of cryptocurrencies continued. The entry of more corporate entities
                    into the crypto space helped push the price higher. Tesla began accepting Bitcoin as a means of
                    payment for its electric vehicles; MicroStrategy continued to accumulate more bitcoins, and El
                    Salvador was preparing a bill to make Bitcoin a legal tender.

                    The increase in adoption from institutional and retail investors pushed Bitcoin to a new all-time
                    high of $64k. However, from May, Bitcoin went on to underperform till September. The poor
                    performance was mostly caused by China’s ban on cryptocurrency-related activities.

                    It began with the various provinces in China banning cryptocurrency mining activities. China
                    accounted for most of Bitcoin’s mining hash rate. Hence, the crypto mining ban resulted in Bitcoin
                    mining’s hash rate declining massively. Thus, resulting in Bitcoin’s price losing more than 50% of
                    its value and dropping below the $30k level in July.

                    The Chinese government didn’t stop there. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) banned financial
                    institutions and corporate entities from engaging in crypto-related transactions. Companies caught
                    processing crypto-related transactions are sanctioned. This move effectively ended crypto trading
                    activities in the Asian country. Thus, resulting in numerous cryptocurrency exchanges ending their
                    services in China. Furthermore, companies such as Alibaba and Bitmain stopped selling crypto mining
                    hardware to Chinese residents.

                    The attack by Elon Musk on Bitcoin and its massive energy usage also contributed to the bearish
                    performance. Tesla discontinued its Bitcoin payment method due to environmental concerns about its
                    energy usage for mining purposes.

                    Bitcoin’s price bounced back in September as miners moved to Europe and North America. The mining
                    hash rate started to recover as the mining farms, and other individual miners found new homes in
                    countries such as The United States, Kazakhstan, Iran, Canada, and several others.

                    El Salvador became the first country in the world to officially make Bitcoin a legal tender in
                    September. Despite the warnings from global financial institutions like the IMF, El Salvador’s
                    Bitcoin adoption is already yielding fruit.

                    Bitcoin slowly rose to reach a new all-time high at $69,044 in November, with the total
                    cryptocurrency market cap reaching a new all-time high of $3 trillion. The increase in demand for
                    Bitcoin by institutional investors and the entry of more corporate entities helped push the market
                    higher.

                    However, Bitcoin is currently down by nearly 30% from its all-time high and is trading around $50k
                    per coin at the moment. The recent poor performance has been attributed to selling pressure in China
                    as exchanges close their operations in the country, and Chinese traders are selling their bitcoins
                    before they lose their money.

                    <span class="fw-bolder">Bitcoin’s Technical Forecast for 2022</span><br>
                    Bitcoin’s technical indicators are negative at the moment due to the coin’s underperformance in
                    recent weeks. The MACD line is still within the bearish region, while the RSI of 46 shows that
                    Bitcoin is facing selling pressure in the market.

                    <span class="fw-bolder">What will the Market Hold in 2022?</span><br>
                    2022 is expected to bring further growth to the cryptocurrency market and to Bitcoin in particular.
                    Jack Dorsey resigned from his role as Twitter CEO and changed Square’s name to Block in a bid to
                    focus on developing products centered on Bitcoin.

                    Market experts are optimistic that 2022 will be a better year for Bitcoin. Vijay Ayyar, vice
                    president of corporate development and global expansion at crypto exchange Luno, is confident that
                    the United States will see the first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in 2022. He said, “The
                    Bitcoin Futures ETF that launched this year has been widely regarded as not very retail-friendly
                    given the high costs involved of rolling over contracts which amount to around 5-10%. Increasing
                    pressure/evidence… points to a Bitcoin Spot ETF being approved in 2022 mainly because the market is
                    now large and mature enough to support one.”

                    Grayscale has filed to convert its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) to a spot Bitcoin ETF, and many
                    are optimistic that the SEC will approve at least one proposal in the coming year.

                    Kate Waltman, a New York-based certified public accountant who specializes in crypto, expects
                    Bitcoin to reach $100,000 in the first quarter of 2022. “The most knowledgeable educators in the
                    space are predicting $100,000 Bitcoin in Q1 2022 or sooner,” she said.
